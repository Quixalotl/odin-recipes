    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>If you've never been tempted to polish off a whole bowl of charoset by yourself, that's about to change. This traditional charoset recipe is a little sweet, a little spiced, and absurdly delicious on some matzo. It comes together in one bowl, in under 15 minutes, with just 8 simple ingredients. Whether you're prepping for a Passover Seder or just craving something naturally sweet and spiced, this stuff seriously over-delivers-minimal effort, maximum flavor, and a classic that never gets old.</p>
    <p>Charoset (חֲרֽוֹסֶת‎ pronounced "haroset") is an essential symbolic food of the Passover Seder, with deep historical roots in the Exodus story. The name comes from the Hebrew word "cheres," meaning clay, representing the mortar the Israelites used in Egypt. But let's be real, this dish is way too good to only enjoy once a year. This version sticks to the classic Ashkenazi style with tart apples, toasted walnuts, a dash of cinnamon, and a splash of sweet kosher wine. It's fresh, flavorful, and the perfect balance for any Passover spread.</p>
    <p>Whether you're spreading it on matzah, making a Hillel sandwich with horseradish, or sneaking spoonfuls straight from the fridge, this charoses will quickly become your new favorite Seder side.</p>
    <p>And if you're building a full Passover feast, don't miss out on my other go-tos: potato kugel, matzo ball soup, tzimmes, and that flourless chocolate cake my family fights over after we sing our hearts out with that classic dancefloor banger, Dayenu. However you enjoy it, this charoset is about to be the star of your Seder (or snack stash). Let's get chopping!</p>
    <p>Also I stole the description above from Cinnamon Snail, along with the recipe below.</p>

    <h2>Why you'll adore this walnut charoset recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tested and Approved Worldwide:</strong>Like all of my vegan Jewish recipes, after tweaking and perfecting, this charosis was shared with a team of testers around the globe who all nailed it on their first try. </li>
        <li><strong>Quick to Make:</strong> You can whip this up in under 15 minutes (not counting the chill time) with just a cutting board, a skillet, and one mixing bowl. Ideal for when you need something fast but still impressive.</li>
        <li><strong>Made with Pantry Staples:</strong> Everything in this recipe-apples, walnuts, cinnamon, cardamom, and even the optional sweet wine or grape juice-is easy to find at any grocery store. No need for specialty shops or hard-to-pronounce ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegan AF & GF:</strong> Like all of my vegan recipes, this Passover charoset is completely pareve, cholesterol-free, and made without causing harm to a single animal or insect. No honey, no dairy, no gluten-just natural, wholesome ingredients that deliver big on flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar (Or Coconut Sugar)</li>
        <li>Cardamom</li>
        <li>Sweet Kosher Wine</li>
        <li>Walnuts</li>
        <li>Orange Zest</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Apples</h3>
    <p>Apples (called "tapuach" in Hebrew) form the base of this charoset. Granny Smith (my fave for making vegan apple pie with), Fuji (which I use in my vegan Japanese curry), or pink lady (the absolute legend for making vegan apple cider donuts and vegan apple muffins) work best for their crisp texture and balance of sweetness and tartness. </p>
    <h3> Brown Sugar (Or Coconut Sugar)</h3>
    <p>A touch of brown sugar ties everything together, bringing subtle molasses depth that pairs perfectly with the apples and walnuts. For a deeper, even more natural sweetness, I also love using coconut sugar or palm sugar (they add a caramelly flavor that's perfect here). Plus, they're a staple for Southeast Asian desserts, like Malaysian kuih ketayap, Indonesian Onde Onde, and Filipino suman malagkit, so I always keep them on hand.</p>
    <h3>Cardamom</h3>
    <p>Hey, not everyone uses cardamom in their charoset, but I think it gives a wonderfully subtle, musky flavor that I'd hate to leave out. Any ground cardamom will work, but I especially love the cloud forest cardamom from Burlap and Barrel.</p>
    <h3>Sweet Kosher Wine</h3>
    <p>For that authentic depth and richness, a sweet kosher wine, like Manischewitz wine, does the trick. If you prefer non-alcoholic, grape juice (growing up, my family always used Kedem) works beautifully, still providing that traditional sweetness and fruitiness.</p>
    <p>But honestly, Kedem is kinda crappy in the sense that it's typically made from concentrate, and some varieties contain preservatives too. There are some bangin' not-from-concentrate organic grape juices out there, and they have better flavor.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Variations</h2>
    <h3>Sephardic Charoset</h3>
    <p>Embrace Sephardic tradition by blending dried fruits like dates, figs, and raisins with chopped almonds and a hint of cinnamon. Some Sephardic recipes also add pomegranate molasses (the stuff I love to use plenty of in my ezme and kisir) or even swap wine for orange juice. </p>
    <h3>Yemenite Charoset</h3>
    <p>This spiced variation brings serious depth with a mix of dates, figs, and currants blended with black pepper, coriander, ginger, or homemade baharat. It's naturally rich, slightly smoky, and a perfect balance of sweet and heat. Scoop it up with Afghani bolani bread or serve it alongside vegan shawarma dripping with zhoug and tahini dressing for an explosion of bold and contrasting flavors.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Finely dice the apples into small pieces and set them aside.
        </li>
        <li>Toast the walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently, until they're lightly browned and fragrant. Let them cool, then chop them finely.
        </li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the diced apples, chopped walnuts, brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, salt, and your sweet kosher wine or grape juice. Stir it all up until evenly mixed.</li>
        <li><p>If you're into a more finely ground charoset, toss the mix into a food processor and pulse it just a few times.</p>
        <p>✅ Just be careful not to overdo it! You aren't looking to puree the stuff to oblivion, just break it up more than maybe your knife skills have time for.</p></li>
        <li>Transfer your charoset to an airtight container and chill it in the fridge for at least 4 hours. Let those flavors mingle and get even more delicious.</li>
        <li>Serve it chilled for the best flavor, or let it sit at room temperature for a softer texture.</li>
    </ol></p>
